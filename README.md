- The Smart HR Office is dedicated to providing employees (clients) with efficient services by utilizing remote procedure call (RPC) methods. 
This software communication protocol allows programs running on different machines on a network to request services without understanding the network's technicalities. 
The goal is to use this technology to provide our employees with a seamless experience and high-quality services such as scheduling meeting, onboarding, and temperature room control.


- A Graphical User Interface ( GUI )  model for an API implemented using the Java Swing framework's JFrame component, providing an intuitive and visually appealing interface for users to interact with the API.
